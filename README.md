Laser SLAM project

This project is base on the algorithms of Real-Time Correlative Scan Matching, Real-Time Loop Closure in 2D LIDAR SLAM.
And it's integrated with ROS2 Humble, on Ubuntu 22.04.

It's now been integrated with fast-correlated-scan-matcher and ceres-scan-matcher. 
But I haven't integrated odometry and IMU processing steps yet, I will do it later if I have time:)

Project Dependents:
1) ROS2 Humble
2) ceres
3) Eigen3
4) offline laser scan dataset(eg.cartographer_paper_deutsches_museum)
